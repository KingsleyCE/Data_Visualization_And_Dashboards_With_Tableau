# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals

The project's objective of this project is to conduct exploratory data analysis and visualization on the FIFA 2018 dataset using Tableau. 

My goal is to uncover insights into player characteristics, determine factors influencing player ratings, and present the findings through an engaging dashboard. 

This involves connecting the dataset, creating visualizations, and building a comprehensive dashboard to answer specific questions about player attributes, performance, value and wage and communicate these insights effectively.

## Process

Connecting the Data: I began by connecting the dataset ‘fifa18_clean.csv’ to Tableau, laying the foundation for my analysis.
Detecting Data Types: I studied the dataset to ensure correct data types, crucial for accurate visualizations. I also identified any missing important data types.

Building Visualizations: Five different visualizations were created, ranging from overall player distributions to detailed positional analyses, helping me uncover key insights.

Identifying Important Features: Through correlation analysis, I was able to pinpointed features significantly impacting player ratings, such as 'Value', 'Acceleration', and 'Balance'.

Creating Final Presentation Visualizations: I then focused on creating compelling visuals for my final presentation, including maps, analytical forecasts, and Show Me table.

Finding Patterns and Trends: I delved into the data to identify outliers, trends, and unexpected patterns, providing valuable context to our analysis.

Detecting Key Points: I identified performance indicators and noteworthy data points, setting the stage for the creation of my dashboard.

Formulating Questions: Questions were carefully crafted to guide my study, such as understanding factors contributing to player ratings and exploring geographical patterns.

Dashboard Creation: Utilizing Tableau, I synthesized my findings into a cohesive dashboard, addressing questions and presenting key insights.

## Results
## Option 2 - Fifa2018 Player Ratings.

Nationality Distribution: A Map illustrating player counts from different nationalities, highlighting the diversity in the dataset.

Player wage analysis: Top 10 Highest Paying Club and Player wage showing outlier 

Player overall rating : Histogram showing player composure with respect to their age.
 
Attribute Analysis: Players attribute analysis by country measured to average earnings.
 
Attribute Analysis: Top countries with the highest overall rating average.

Player value distribution: Line graph showing Player Age in relation to their Potential over time

Player value distribution: Line chart exploring trends over time - Comparing average player Wage and how it corresponds to Age.

Main Data Question: What factors contribute most to a player's overall rating? Their composure.

Dataset Selection: FIFA 2018 dataset with 70 attributes.

Features Explored: 'Value', 'Acceleration', 'Balance', 'Ball Control', and more.


## Challenges 

The process was not without challenges. The data sheer size with 70 features presented the challenge of selection the most meaningful and impactful ones. 

Ensuring data accuracy and addressing potential outliers demanded careful attention.

Working with the large dataset ensuring data quality and also making sure to address missing values, an example was changing nationality data type from string to geographical/region. 

Also Some Nationality had unmatching location so I corrected that, example was countries (-England, Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales) are grouped in the United Kingdom.

## Future Goal

With additional time, I would delve deeper into forecasting analyses, exploring player groupings based on performance. 
I would also conduct sentiment analysis on textual attributes, enriching my understanding of player characteristics beyond numerical values.

In conclusion, my perusal through the FIFA 2018 dataset has been insightful and enriching and made playing and watching score more interesting.

The carefully crafted visualizations and thoughtful analyses have paved the way for a detailed dashboard, encapsulating the essence of my exploration.
